        The Regional Coastal Resilience Assessments were developed by the
        National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF), in partnership with the
        National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and UNC
        Ashevilleâ€™s National Environmental Modeling and Analysis Center (NEMAC)
        and in consultation with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and
        NatureServe. The Coastal Resilience Evaluation and Siting Tool (CREST)
        provides an interactive platform to view and interact with the results
        of the Regional Coastal Resilience Assessments.

        The Regional Assessments seek to identify areas on the landscape where
        the implementation of nature-based solutions have potential to maximize
        benefits for human community resilience to flooding threats and fish and
        wildlife habitat. In 2019, NFWF launched CREST to share results of the
        Regional Assessments for the U.S. Atlantic, Gulf of America, and Pacific
        coastlines, which use a standardized methodology to combine information
        about flooding threats, human community assets, and fish and wildlife
        species to identify Resilience Hubs. The Regional Assessments have since
        expanded to include Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Northern
        Mariana Islands, Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, Alaska, and the U.S.
        Great Lakes. Owing to the uniqueness of each region, the methods will
        continue to be refined and enhanced. Assessments for all other U.S.
        regions are being updated. Updated data and reports will be added to
        CREST once available.

        CREST provides an online, interactive environment to access Regional
        Assessment results. It allows users to:
        <CrestList>
          <li>
            View and explore key Assessment inputs and results within their own
            areas of interest,
          </li>
          <li>
            Analyze potential project sites and quantify results from the
            Assessment models, and
          </li>
          <li>Search Resilience Hubs to identify potential project sites.</li>
          {/* <li>
            Provide advanced GIS users with the ability to download all of the
            final Regional Assessment datasets for use in their own GIS
            platform.

        CREST is intended to be used as a screening-level tool designed to help
        identify areas that may be well suited for nature-based solutions. As
        with all GIS analyses, site-level assessments are required to validate
        results and develop detailed design and engineering plans. The results
        are limited by those data available at the time of analysis and by the
        underlying accuracy and precision of the original data sources;
        therefore, the Regional Assessments may not capture all flood-related
        threats, community assets, fish and wildlife resources, or areas of open
        space. For instance, significant data gaps exist in many regions
        including limited coastal flood-related and soil datasets across Alaska,
        limited storm surge data for Pacific Island regions, and lack of data
        that incorporate recent land subsidence in American Samoa. Resilience
        Hubs are not intended to identify all potential opportunities for
        nature-based solutions, but rather are meant to help assess potential
        projects based on dual benefits for habitats and human communities.

        In April 2025, the CREST user interface was updated to improve
        functionality and enhance the user experience. Changes improve the
        overall design while allowing users to more easily export results and
        maps, search for areas and watersheds of interest, and view LandCover
        data. The redesigned Explore Resilience Hubs tab allows users to explore
        Resilience Hubs in their area of interest and identify variation within
        Hub scores in regions where a Resilience Hub Grid is available (Guam,
        American Samoa, Alaska, and the U.S. Great Lakes). For additional

        . In addition to the Regional Coastal Resilience Assessments, NFWF and
        NOAA partnered with NatureServe to complete Targeted Watershed
        Assessments for eight watersheds throughout the U.S. CREST also features
        the results from each targeted watershed. */}
