              The Regional Coastal Resilience Assessments were developed by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF), in partnership with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and UNC Asheville’s National Environmental Modeling and Analysis Center (NEMAC) and in consultation with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and NatureServe. The Coastal Resilience Evaluation and Siting Tool (CREST) provides an interactive platform to view, download, and interact with the results ofthe Regional Coastal Resilience Assessments

              The Assessment seeks to identify areas on the landscape where the implementation of nature-based solutions have potential to maximize benefits for human community resilience and fish and wildlife habitat. In 2019, NFWF launched CREST to share resultsof the Regional Assessments for the U.S. Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Pacific coastlines, which use a standardized methodology to combine information about flooding threats, human community assets, and fish and wildlife species to identify Resilience Hubs. The Regional Assessments have since expanded to include Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands. Owing to the uniqueness of each region, the methods will continue to be refined and enhanced. CREST will be updated regularly as additional Regional Assessments are completed in Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, Alaska, and the Great Lakes.

              The Community Exposure Index explores the relationship between potential flooding threats and the presence of community assets by combining two composite indices: the Threat Index and the Community Asset Index. The Threat Index utilizes landscape characteristics and flood-related data. The Community Asset Index helps to understand where critical infrastructure, facilities, and population are concentrated on the landscape. Together, these indices combine to identify areas where community assets overlap with flood threats, also known as exposure.While individual data inputs vary regionally, the Regional Coastal Resilience Assessments utilize standardized methods to calculate the Community Exposure Index.

              IndexThe Fish and Wildlife Index identifies areas on the landscape where species and their habitats are located, thus helping to understand areas where implementing nature-based solutions are likely to benefit federal or state designated species of concern. While the Regional Coastal Resilience Assessments consistently combine species data to create a single Fish and Wildlife Index, methods vary between the continental U.S. (CONUS) and other regional assessments. In CONUS, a Terrestrial and Aquatic Index are combined based principally on rarity-weighted richness. Importantly, in CONUS, the Aquatic Index includes both freshwater and marine species, but focuses almost exclusively on very shallow, nearshore areas.

              Implementing significant enhancements to the Fish and Wildlife Index methods, regional assessments in Puerto Rico,the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands combine Terrestrial and Marine Indices. Unlike CONUS, the Terrestrial Index attempts to identify suitable habitat based on the habitat preferences of major taxonomic groups  (e.g., birds, reptiles, mammals, amphibians, and freshwater fishes and invertebrates). The Marine Index considers habitat to a 30 meter depth contour, utilizing the best available data to identify marine habitat types capable of supporting significant biodiversity (e.g., coral reefs, mangroves, and seagrass beds). CREST automatically displays the results for each region based on the methods applied. For details, review the <a href="./#Download" >final reports</a>.

              Resilience Hubs are areas of open space or habitat where resilience projects may have the greatest potential to benefit both human community resilience and fish and wildlife. The Hubs combine information about natural open spaces, flooding threats, community assets, and fish and wildlife resources. As the primary output of the Regional Coastal Resilience Assessments, Resilience Hubs are common to all regions. However, the methods used to develop Resilience Hubs do vary regionally, with significant methodological enhancements made in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands.
